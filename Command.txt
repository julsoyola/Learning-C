gcHi!

As you may have encountered in order to run these .c files 
you need to use the shell 

Super easy though!

1. Check to see if your're in the right dir
 - write in ' pwd ' in the command line
 -  Does it say ' /home/runner/Intro-to-C/C
 - Yes? Great Move on to step 2
 - No ? what ever you are missing cd in so..
 - ' cd C '  to get into the file. 
 - to check if you're right ' ls ' into the line
 - All your files will be in there
 2. Woo so now that you're in the dir
 - Put 'gcc fileName.c' enter 
 (fileName meaning the file ur trying to use, aka like Hello.c)
 - now ' ./a.out ' 
 - and yay good to go
